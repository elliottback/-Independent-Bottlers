# Introduction

Harald Kirsch, the original author of this document, has kindly allowed me to port it to GitHub so that it can be a living guide to Independent Bottlers of Scotch Whisky.

Please feel free to fork and submit merge requests to correct, enhance, or improve this text in any way! 

# Source

This document is initially based on the [2008 v44e: Harry's Guide of Independent Bottlers](http://www.whiskyfun.com/Harrys-guide44e.pdf) distributed on [Serge Valentin's WhiskyFun](http://www.whiskyfun.com/) website.  The original source is no longer available, so I have reconstructed it in Markdown as best I can.

## Versions

There are two versions of the PDF guide which I've been able to find, and reproduce here for posterity:

* [44e](pdf/guide44e.pdf)
* [44g](pdf/guide44g.pdf)
