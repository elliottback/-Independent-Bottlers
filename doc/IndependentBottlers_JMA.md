The name of this company (founded in 1982) comes from a historical personality:
James MacArthur
He was a Farmer, who travelled much and often and stayed in hotels next to the
distilleries in Scotland for overnight, where he got an extra dram directly from the
barrel.
The backlabel of each bottle tells a small history of the respective distillery from
where the whisky comes and a tastingnote also. On the frontlabel you can find a
picture from a still, the business logo, the age of the whisky in years and the alcohol
strength (regularly 43%). One indication is missing: the year of destillation and
the bottling date.
Usually it comes with a standard clear liqueur bottle, and sometimes it comes with a simply thin
cardboard box with just the still picture and the logo printed on it. No further details on the box.
In 1994 MacArthur bottled a range of whiskies with the label: „In Celebration 500 Years of
Scotch Whisky 1494 –1994” This range were bottled at caskstrength, in a green standard
liqueur bottle. James MacArthur has a range from the lower to the upper prices. Some details are
missing on the label, for example if they are using coloring and/or chill filtering.
