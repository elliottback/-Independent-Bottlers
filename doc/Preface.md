# Chapter I - Preface

Whisky became popular in the last years; to collectors as well as to "drinkers" (or should we say drinking collectors?). If you are concerned with whisky, you will examine that there are original bottlings (OB) from the distillery and independent bottlings (IB) from independent bottlers.

Information about the numerous independent bottlers are very rare in books and even on the internet you cannot find much about them. Some bottlers are not hosting a page on the Web.

This document should remedy these abuses and on the other hand it should show you and describe the different labels and series which were released by independent bottlers.

There are no tasting notes in this document!

I'm sorry, but I can't describe all independent bottlers or take a photo of there bottlings. It's very difficult to do this with old bottlings. If they are still available, they are high-prized. If you have a picture that's missing don't hesitate to send a pull request!  If you have more or better information about one of the bottlers (i.e. Address, Telephoneone number etc.) â€“ let me know, please. If you send me a picture, the source will be displayed directly at the photo.
