### Source

This document is initially based on the [2008 v44e: Harry's Guide of Independent Bottlers](http://www.whiskyfun.com/Harrys-guide44e.pdf) distributed on [Serge Valentin's WhiskyFun](http://www.whiskyfun.com/) website.  The original source is no longer available, so I have reconstructed it in Markdown as best I can.

### Versions

There are two versions of the PDF guide which I've been able to find, and reproduce here for posterity:

* [4.4 english](../pdf/guide44e.pdf) 
* [4.4 german](../pdf/guide44g.pdf)

These should be considered "historical" documents, as they will not be updated and will drift out of sync with the github version I am maintaining.
